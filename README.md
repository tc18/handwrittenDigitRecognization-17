# handwrittenDigitRecognization-17

Abstractâ€”In the pattern recognition field, interest has been grown in recent years for multiple classifier systems. These methods aim at inducing an ensemble of classifiers by producing diversity at different levels. Following this principle, Our work aims at studying classifiers to recognize a digit in a strictly pragmatic approach and make it to the distributed level. For that purpose we have experimented the Random Forest algorithm and Convolutional Neural Network considered as the prime reference algorithm for the MNIST handwritten digits database. In this paper, we describe random forest classifier and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and review methods and how to build it in parallel or distributed system. Next we present our experimental results. We finally draw some conclusions on random forest vs CNN global behavior according to their time of execution and accuracy tuning.
